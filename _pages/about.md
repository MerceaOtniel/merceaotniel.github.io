I am a final-year PhD candidate jointly affiliated with the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) and the [University of Tubingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), part of the [IMPRS-IS doctoral program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/). My research is supervised by [Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=SrVnrPcAAAAJ&hl=en). During my PhD, I was also a guest PhD student at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) and [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), supervised by [Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ&hl=en).

I earned my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) in 2020, completing my thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Amos Storkey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Rlc8EAAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I obtained my BEng in Computers and Information technology from [Politehnica University of Timisoara](https://www.upt.ro/Universitatea-Politehnica-Timisoara_en.html) in 2019, with my undergraduate thesis supervised by [Prof. Calin-Adrian Popa](https://scholar.google.ro/citations?user=U6prQIkAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have had the privilege of applying my research expertise in industry through several impactful opportunities. In the autumn of 2024, I interned at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), where I worked under the supervision of Stefano Pellegrini, [Jasper Uijlings](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=jInmtEkAAAAJ&hl=en/), and [Cordelia Schmid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IvqCXP4AAAAJ&hl=en) on enhancing SAM 2 for scenarios involving significant occlusion or movement. Previously, from 2023 to 2024, I spent eight months at [Google Research](https://research.google/teams/perception/), collaborating with [Anurag Arnab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l2FS2_IAAAAJ&hl=en), [Alexey Gritsenko](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=zTy9cUwAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Cordelia Schmid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IvqCXP4AAAAJ&hl=en) on the efficient adaptation of large-scale models. During this time, I also worked with [Aleksandra Nowak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2A-eZhQAAAAJ&hl=en), [Utku Evci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8yGMMwcAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Yann Dauphin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XSforroAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) on a related project in efficient adaptation strategies. Prior to these roles, I was a Machine Learning Researcher at [Everseen](https://everseen.com/), where I focused on real-time multi-camera tracking systems.

Most of my research focuses on improving deep learning efficiency through data-efficient (low-shot) and model-efficient (adaptation) methods for large-scale models. Furthermore, I have extensive experience in multimodal learning, including audio-visual learning and multi-modal large language models, as well as in video semantic segmentation and tracking.
