Currently, I am a Machine Learning Researcher at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/careers/uk/teams/software-and-services.html), working on multimodal learning.

I did my PhD in CS with a specialization in AI at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) and the [University of Tubingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), supervised by [Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=SrVnrPcAAAAJ&hl=en) within the [IMPRS-IS doctoral program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/). I was also a guest PhD student at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) and [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), supervised by [Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ&hl=en). I earned my MSc in AI from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) in 2020, with a thesis supervised by [Prof. Amos Storkey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Rlc8EAAAAAJ&hl=en), and my BEng in Computers and Information technology from [Politehnica University of Timisoara](https://www.upt.ro/Universitatea-Politehnica-Timisoara_en.html) in 2019, with a thesis supervised by [Prof. Calin-Adrian Popa](https://scholar.google.ro/citations?user=U6prQIkAAAAJ&hl=en).

I applied my research expertise in industry through impactful roles, including internships at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) (Autumn 2024), supervised by Stefano Pellegrini, [Jasper Uijlings](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=jInmtEkAAAAJ&hl=en/), and [Cordelia Schmid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IvqCXP4AAAAJ&hl=en), on improving SAM 2 for significant occlusion and movement scenarios; and [Google Research](https://research.google/teams/perception/) (2023â€“2024), collaborating with [Anurag Arnab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l2FS2_IAAAAJ&hl=en), [Alexey Gritsenko](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=zTy9cUwAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Cordelia Schmid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IvqCXP4AAAAJ&hl=en) on efficient adaptation of large-scale models. I also collaborated with [Aleksandra Nowak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2A-eZhQAAAAJ&hl=en), [Utku Evci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8yGMMwcAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Yann Dauphin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XSforroAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) on related projects. Previously, I was a ML Researcher at [Everseen](https://everseen.com/), developing real-time multi-camera tracking systems.

My research focuses on improving the efficiency of deep learning through data-efficient (low-shot) and model-efficient adaptation methods for large-scale models. I also have extensive experience in multimodal learning (audio-visual, multimodal language models) and video semantic segmentation and tracking.
