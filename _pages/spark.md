**"SPark - Community-Driven Smart Parking"** is a community-driven mobile application that tries to deal with the lack of available parking places in a big city by using a platform that gives users access to post their own parking spots and the time slots when the parking spot will be free. Then, the other users can reserve that parking spot for a specific time interval, thus creating the opportunity for drivers to manage the parking spots in a very efficient way.

**Technologies: Java EE, Rest Api, Android, Oracle Database.**
