This project aims to reduce the physical interaction between a driver and the mobile phone by using the mobile phone's camera to detect hand gestures using neural networks. In this way, a driver could control the phone with finger gestures while keeping the hands on the wheel. In order to detect the gestures, we used a Temporal Relation Network. Technologies: Python, Android, PyTorch.
