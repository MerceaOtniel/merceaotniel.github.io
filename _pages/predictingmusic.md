# Predicting Music Success through Audio, Lyrics and Metadata

This project has the goal of creating a system that given the lyrics, the metadata and the melody of a song it is able to predict how popular that song will be. For this, we created our own dataset using Genius for extracting lyrics and Spotify for extracting the melody and the metadata. Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Spotify API, Genius API
