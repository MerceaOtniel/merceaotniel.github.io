# SafeStreet

This project aims to use video streamed by a drone in order to detect if some violent behaviour is recognised. In this way, autonomous drones could detect unusual behaviour and alert police. We used a recurrent CNN to detect potential violent behaviours in the video streamed by the drone. Technologies: Python, Keras, Shell script, OpenCV.
