**"SafeStreet"** is a project that aims to use video streamed by a drone to detect if some violent behavior is recognized. In this way, autonomous drones could detect unusual behavior and alert police. We used a recurrent CNN to detect potential violent behaviors in the video streamed by the drone.

**Technologies: Python, Keras, Shell script, OpenCV.**

Awards won with this project: **Grand Prize awarded at HackTM Sibiu edition**. HackTm is the biggest software and hardware hackathon in South Eastern Europe.
