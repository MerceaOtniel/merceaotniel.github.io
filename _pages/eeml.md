I was selected to attend the "Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School", organized mainly by Google DeepMind from 1-6 July 2019 (only 160 candidates were chosen out of 738 candidates, ranging from undergraduates to professors). I was among the only 12 undergrads selected. Moreover, I attended the "Timisoara Machine Learning Workshop", a satellite event for this school. Jul. 2019
