I was selected to attend the "Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School", organised mainly by Google DeepMind during 1-6 July 2019 (only 160 candidates were selected out of 738 candidates, ranging from undergraduates to professors). I was among the only 10 undergrads selected. Moreover, I attended "Timisoara Machine Learning Workshop" which was a satellite event to this school. Jul. 2019
