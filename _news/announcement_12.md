I have finished my 4 month internship at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I have worked on enhancing SAM 2 for scenarios involving significant occlusion or movement, under the supervision of Stefano Pellegrini, [Jasper Uijlings](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=jInmtEkAAAAJ&hl=en/) and [Cordelia Schmid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IvqCXP4AAAAJ&hl=en).
