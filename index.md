I am currently a PhD student in the **[International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent systems (IMPRS-IS) doctoral program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)** since May 2021, where I am working under the supervision of **[Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata)** and **[Prof. Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/)**.
I am primary interested in multi-modal learning, zero/few-shot learning, foundation models and explainability and interpretability.



Prior, I did an MSc in AI at the University of Edinburgh. The title of my MSc thesis was "What neural networks can not learn?" and it was done under the supervision of **[Prof. Amos Storkey](https://www.bayeswatch.com/)**. The goal of the thesis was to find very easy tasks, in a non-distributional shift scenario, on which current CNNs fail badly.

I did my BEng in Computers and Information technology at Politehnica University of Timisoara. The title of my BSc thesis was "HybridAlpha: Reinforcement Learning on resource-constrained systems" and my supervisor was **[Prof. Calin-Adrian Popa](https://sites.google.com/site/popacalinadrian/)**. The goal of the thesis was to find if the performance of AlphaZero can be improved when it is run on resource-constrained systems.
