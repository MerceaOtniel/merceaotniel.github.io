**Currently**

- I am an incoming Research Intern at **[Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/)**, starting September 2024. 


**Educational background**

- I was a PhD student at the **[Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/)** and the **[University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/)**, part of the **[IMPRS-IS doctoral program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)**.  Supervisors: **[Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=SrVnrPcAAAAJ&hl=en)**. I focused on multi-modal and zero/few-shot learning and efficient adaptation of large-scale models. **Thesis yet to be submitted**.
- I was a Guest PhD Student at **[Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en)** and the **[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/)**, under the supervision of Prof. Zeynep Akata.
- I did an MSc in AI at the **[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)**. My MSc thesis title was "What neural networks can not learn?". Supervisor: **[Prof. Amos Storkey](https://www.bayeswatch.com/)**. 
- I earned my BEng in Computers and Information technology at **[Politehnica University of Timisoara](https://www.upt.ro/Universitatea-Politehnica-Timisoara_en.html)**. My BEng thesis title was "HybridAlpha: Reinforcement Learning on resource-constrained systems". Supervisor: **[Prof. Calin-Adrian Popa](https://sites.google.com/site/popacalinadrian/)**. 

**Previous research experience**
- I was a Research Intern and, afterward, a Student Researcher at **[Google Research](https://research.google/teams/perception/)**, working with **[Anurag Arnab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l2FS2_IAAAAJ&hl=en)**, **[Alexey Gritsenko](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=zTy9cUwAAAAJ&hl=en)**,  and **[Cordelia Schmid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IvqCXP4AAAAJ&hl=en)** on efficient adaptation of large-scale models. Also collaborated with **[Aleksandra Nowak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2A-eZhQAAAAJ&hl=pl)**, **[Utku Evci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8yGMMwcAAAAJ&hl=en)**, and **[Yann Dauphin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XSforroAAAAJ&hl=en)** from **[Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/)** on a related project.
- I was a Machine Learning Researcher at **[Everseen](https://everseen.com/)**, working on real-time multi-camera tracking.
