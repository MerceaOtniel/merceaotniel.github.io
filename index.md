**Currently**

- I am an incoming Research Intern at **[Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/)**, starting in September 2024. 
- I am a PhD student at the **[Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/)** and **[University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/)**, being part of the **[IMPRS-IS doctoral program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)** since May 2021. I am working under the supervision of **[Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=SrVnrPcAAAAJ&hl=en)**. I am primary interested in multi-modal and zero/few-shot learning, efficient adaptation of large-scale models.
- I am Guest PhD Student at **[Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en)** and **[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/)**, conducting research in multi-modal learning under the supervision of Prof. Zeynep Akata, as part of my PhD.
