I am currently a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and University of Tubingen, being part of the **[International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent systems (IMPRS-IS) doctoral program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)** since May 2021, where I am working under the supervision of **[Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata)** and **[Prof. Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/)**.
I am primary interested in multi-modal learning, zero/few-shot learning, foundation models and explainability and interpretability.

During July-November 2023, I was a Research Intern at **[Google Research](https://research.google/teams/perception/)**, working with **[Anurag Arnab](https://anuragarnab.github.io/)**, **[Alexey Gritsenko](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=zTy9cUwAAAAJ&hl=en)**  and **[Cordelia Schmid](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/people_webpages/cordelia/)** on efficient adaptation of large-scale models.  

Prior to my PhD I worked for 6 months as Machine Learning Researcher at **[Everseen](https://everseen.com/)**, where I worked in the area of real-time multi-camera tracking, contributing to the development of multiple patents.

I did an MSc in AI with Distinction at the **[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)**. The title of my MSc thesis was "What neural networks can not learn?" and it was done under the supervision of **[Prof. Amos Storkey](https://www.bayeswatch.com/)**. The goal of the thesis was to find very easy tasks, in a non-distributional shift scenario, on which current CNNs fail badly.

I did my BEng in Computers and Information technology at **[Politehnica University of Timisoara](https://www.upt.ro/Universitatea-Politehnica-Timisoara_en.html)**. The title of my BEng thesis was "HybridAlpha: Reinforcement Learning on resource-constrained systems" and my supervisor was **[Prof. Calin-Adrian Popa](https://sites.google.com/site/popacalinadrian/)**. The goal of the thesis was to find if the performance of AlphaZero can be improved when it is run on resource-constrained systems.
